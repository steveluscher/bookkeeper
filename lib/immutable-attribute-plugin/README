EnsuresImmutabilityOf
=====================

There are many cases where a model attribute should not be changed once it's set. This plugin makes it dead simple.

Example
=======

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  ensures_immutability_of :username, :email
end

account = Account.create(:username => 'jgreen')
...
account.update(:username => 'jgreen')  # raises ActiveRecord::ImmutableAttributeError

Entire models can be made immutable by passing the symbol :all to ensures_immutability_of

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  ensures_immutability_of :all
end

Collections can all be immutable as well (thanks to Dmitry Ratnikov on #rubyonrails)

class Account  < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :infos
  ensures_immutability_of :username, :email, :infos   # note: this must come after the has_many declaration, otherwise
                                                      # AR will overwrite the setter
end

account = Account.create(:username => 'wmoxam')
account.infos = Info.find(:all, :conditions => ["id < ?", 3]
account.infos =  Info.find(:all, :conditions => ["id > ?", 3]  # raises ActiveRecord::ImmutableAttributeError
